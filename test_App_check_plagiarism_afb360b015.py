================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-215: Information Exposure Through Debug Information
Issue: The use of the ‘global’ keyword can potentially lead to the exposure of sensitive information as it allows the variable to be modified outside the local context or scope of the function.
Solution: Avoid using global variables when possible. Instead, consider using function parameters, return statements, or lightweight classes to encapsulate variables.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The functions 'cosine_similarity' and 'TfidfVectorizer' could expose sensitive information if the content of the text being processed is sensitive in nature. The transformed data, if intercepted, could be reverse-engineered to a certain extent.
Solution: Ensure the processed text contents are properly sanitized and stripped of any confidential or personally identifiable information (PII) before being processed.

Vulnerability: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')
Issue: In the 'check_plagiarism' function, the method 'copy()' is used which can result in high memory consumption if 's_vectors' is very large.
Solution: Consider using different strategies to avoid copying the entire data structure, such as using array slicing, generators, or implementing a more memory-efficient algorithm.

================================================================================
Test Scenario 1: Check logic for empty student vectors
- s_vectors is initialized as an empty list
- check_plagiarism function is invoked
- Assert that the function exits gracefully without any errors
- Assert that the returned set is empty

Test Scenario 2: Check logic for a single pair of student vectors
- s_vectors is initialized with vectors of only two students
- check_plagiarism function is invoked
- Assert that the function completes successfully
- Assert that the returned set contains the similarity score of the two students

Test Scenario 3: Check logic for multiple pairs of student vectors
- s_vectors is initialized with vectors of more than two students
- check_plagiarism function is invoked
- Assert that the function completes successfully
- Assert that the returned set contains the similarity scores of all student pairs

Test Scenario 4: Check logic for identical student vectors
- s_vectors is initialized with identical vectors for multiple students
- check_plagiarism function is invoked
- Assert that the function completes successfully
- Assert that the returned set contains matching similarity scores (should be 1) for all student pairs

Test Scenario 5: Check logic for completely distinct student vectors
- s_vectors is initialized with completely dissimilar vectors for multiple students
- check_plagiarism function is invoked
- Assert that the function completes successfully
- Assert that the returned set contains matching similarity scores (should be 0) for all student pairs

Test Scenario 6: Check logic when the similarity function returns an unexpected value
- Mock the similarity function to return an unexpected value
- s_vectors is initialized with some random vectors
- check_plagiarism function is invoked
- Assert that the function handles this scenario gracefully

Test Scenario 7: Check logic when the similarity function takes a longer time
- Mock the similarity function to delay its response
- s_vectors is initialized with some random vectors
- check_plagiarism function is invoked
- Assert that the function handles this scenario gracefully
