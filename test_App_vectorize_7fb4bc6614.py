================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: OWASP Top 10 - A1 Injection
Issue: Although it's not apparent from this code snippet, injection attacks are usually the top security risk with programming. If user input is processed improperly, an attacker can inject malicious code.
Solution: Validate, filter and sanitize user input properly. Use secure APIs that avoid use of the interpreter or provide a parameterized interface. Avoid detailed error messages that provide a lot of information to attacker.

Vulnerability: OWASP Top 10 - A6 Security Misconfiguration
Issue: Good security requires consistent configuration of the software, web server, application server, DB server, and platform. All of these can be vulnerable if not configured properly.
Solution: Use harden images of your platform. Remove or not install unused features, components, documentation, and samples. Regularly update and patch all systems. Automate a process to verify the effectiveness of the configurations and settings in all environments.

Vulnerability: Use of outdated / vulnerable libraries
Issue: The code uses external libraries, which could have known vulnerabilities that can be exploited.
Solution: Always keep the libraries up-to-date and use tools to detect vulnerable libraries.

================================================================================
1. Scenario: Empty Input
   Description: Verify that the function returns an empty result when an empty string is passed as input.

2. Scenario: Non Empty Input
   Description: Verify that the function returns the correct result when a non-empty string is passed as input. The input string could be a simple sentence without any special characters.

3. Scenario: String with Numbers
   Description: Verify that the function successfully works with strings which include numbers in them.

4. Scenario: String with Special Characters
   Description: Verify that the function successfully works with strings which include special characters in them.

5. Scenario: String with Unicode Characters
   Description: Verify that the function successfully works with strings which include Unicode characters in them.

6. Scenario: Large Text Input
   Description: Verify that the function successfully works with large text inputs. This will test the function's performance and memory management. The result should also be correct.

7. Scenario: Multiple Sentence Text Input
   Description: Verify the function can handle multiple sentences correctly. This will test the function's ability to handle newline, fullstop and comma separators, and the result is valid.

8. Scenario: List of Strings as Input
   Description: Verify the function can handle multiple sentences in a list. This will test the function's ability to handle list as input and return the expected result. 

9. Scenario: String with HTML Tags
   Description: Verify that the function successfully works with strings which have HTML tags in them. This will test the function's resistance to HTML tags.

10. Scenario: String with Emoticons/Emoji
    Description: Verify that the function successfully works with strings which have emoticons/emoji in them. This will test the function's capability with non-alphanumeric characters.
