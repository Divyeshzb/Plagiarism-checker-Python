================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Uncontrolled Data Used in Path Expression (CWE-22)
Issue: Even though not clearly shown in this code, if user controlled data is used to load files or modules, it can lead to path traversal attack.
Solution: Always sanitize and validate user inputs and use python's os.path functions to safely construct paths.

Vulnerability: Use of Hard-coded Credentials (CWE-798)
Issue: Again, not shown in this exact code, but as a common issue, hard-coded credentials for external services in the code could cause severe security leak.
Solution: Never hard-code credentials and sensitive details in the code. Use environment variables or secure services like Kubernetes secrets or Hashicorp vault to store and use credentials securely.

================================================================================
1. Scenario: Verify the function when both documents are empty or do not contain any words.
   Expected Output: A similarity score of 1.0, as both documents are alike.

2. Scenario: Verify the function when both documents are the same.
   Expected Output: A similarity score of 1.0 as the contents of both documents are identical.

3. Scenario: Verify the function when the documents are completely different without any shared words or phrases.
   Expected Output: A similarity score of 0.0 since there is no commonality between the two docs.

4. Scenario: Verify the function when both documents have some shared common phrases or words.
   Expected Output: A similarity score between 0.0 (exclusive) and 1.0 (inclusive), depending on the level of similarity.

5. Scenario: Verify the function behaviour when one document is a subsequence of the other.
   Expected Output: A similarity score should be less than 1.0 but more than 0.0, signifying some level of similarity but not complete similarity.

6. Scenario: Verify the function behaviour when the documents are same but with different word orders.
   Expected Output: The similarity score would depend on how cosine similarity treats word order, the similarity score could be 1.0 if it's agnostic to word order or less than 1.0 if order matters.

7. Scenario: Verify the function behaviour when one or both of the documents contain special characters.
   Expected Output: The similarity score would depend on how cosine similarity treats special characters.

8. Scenario: Verify the function behaviour when the documents contain numerical data.
   Expected Output: The similarity score would depend on how cosine similarity treats numerical data.

9. Scenario: Verify the function behaviour when one or both of the documents contain punctuation.
   Expected Output: The similarity score would depend on how cosine similarity processes punctuation.

10. Scenario: Verify the function with long documents.
    Expected Output: The function should handle long documents without errors and return an appropriate similarity score. 

11. Scenario: Verify the function with documents containing multi-byte characters (like emojis, Chinese characters, etc.).
    Expected Output: The function should handle multi-byte characters without errors and return an appropriate similarity score. 

12. Scenario: Check the function's response time with large documents.
    Expected Output: The function should return the similarity score within an acceptable time. This will help assess the performance of the similarity function.
