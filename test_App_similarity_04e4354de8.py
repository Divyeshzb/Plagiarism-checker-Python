================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Outdated third-party libraries
Issue: The code uses sklearn, a third-party library. Outdated third-party libraries can have known vulnerabilities that can be taken advantage of.
Solution: Always keep the third-party libraries up-to-date. Regularly check for updates and apply them. Use the command 'pip install --upgrade package-name' to upgrade a specific package.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Identical Documents
Given two identical documents as input, the function similarity should return 1, indicating total similarity. 

Scenario 2: Completely Different Documents
Given two completely different documents with no common content, the function similarity should return 0, indicating no similarity. 

Scenario 3: Partially Similar Documents
Given two partially similar documents, the function similarity should return a float between 0 and 1, where 0 means no similarity and 1 indicates total similarity. The returned value should reflect the level of similarity between the two documents. 

Scenario 4: Documents with Same Content but Different Sequence
Given two documents containing all the same elements but in a different sequence, the function similarity should still consider them as similar. The similarity metric should not be affected by sequence of content. 

Scenario 5: Documents with Different Casing
Given two documents with the same content, but differing in casing (upper case vs lower case), the function similarity should return a high similarity score as the content is the same. This depends on if the cosine similarity function considers case as a factor. 

Scenario 6: One or Both Documents are Empty
Given that one or both of the documents in the input pair are empty, the function similarity should handle this gracefully. If both are empty, it could be argued that they are completely similar (return 1), but if only one is empty, return 0 as there is no comparison to be made.

Scenario 7: Large Documents
Given two large documents, the function similarity should still be able to calculate and return a similarity score in a timely manner. 

Scenario 8: Documents With Special Characters
Given that the documents contain symbols or special characters, the function similarity should successfully calculate the score without any errors thrown during execution. 

Scenario 9: Similarity with Punctuation
Given two documents where one contains punctuation and the other has the same words but no punctuation, the function similarity should compare the two correctly and return an accurate similarity score on how it considers punctuation in similarity. 

Scenario 10: Non-English Documents
Given two non-English documents, the function similarity should still be able to accurately calculate the similarity between them.
